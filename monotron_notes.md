RATE: (speed) the speed of LFO (watch led)
INT. probably depth of an LFO (8), determines how strong the LFO modulates
pitch or filter
SWITCH: select wave type (triangle or square) of an LFO
FEEDBACK: intensity of feedback - how long it takes the delay to fade out?
if over half then delay bilds up like an avalanche.


TODO: volume control should be at very end of the chain
