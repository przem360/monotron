To start playing with synth just turn on volume and cutoff sliders and click on the SAW or SQR button to choose the wave form.  
Move the MIC slider to let in some sounds from microphone to the mix and start playing or making noises - have fun.  
If you want to record your performance click NEW in the RECORD box, create new .wav file and click START.
